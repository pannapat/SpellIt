# Install NPM
You need the node package manager (NPM) 
To check whether you have it in your terminal, command line, type: `npm -v`
If it shows a version of npm, you're good. 
Otherwise, just go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install NPM.

# Install Angular Project's Dependencies
The following command will look at package.json file under the project directory and install all stuff under "dependencies" and "devDependencies" which includes Angular CLI (commands starts with 'ng')
```
> npm install
```

# Run the project
To serve the project to the browser, run:
```
> ng serve -o
```
The -o flag tells the CLI to launch your browser with the project. 
Now, you're able to watch your Angular 6 project as you code and it will ***automatically reload*** the page on browser for you.
